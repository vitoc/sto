# Sprint-based Technical Onboarding Objectives

Get technically onboarded to the Microsoft Azure approach to field-based development work in sprints :)

## Sprints

### Sprint 1: Version control and Github

* Do: [Hello World!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* Read: [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* Do: [Schedule the next sprint review with Outlook](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/schedule-a-meeting-with-other-people-5c9877bc-ab91-4a7c-99fb-b0b68d7ea94f)

For the last item above, please actually send an invite to your human onboarding guide :)

### Sprint 2: Collaborating and communicating around code

* Read: [Communicating with Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)
* Read: [Forking projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
* Do: Fork this project, replace the bullet points for tasks within this document with ticks on tasks that you'd completed (You can just use the edit functio in GitHub to do this).


### Sprint 3: Getting familiar with VS Code as an IDE

* Do: [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Do: [Clone the **fork (your fork)** of this repository locally using VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository)

### Sprint 4 Be aware of the Integrated Terminal

* Read: [Learn how to bring up the Integrated Terminal in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)
* Do: Bring up the Integrated Terminal in your VS Code. In the Bash command line, do:
```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/vitoc/stoo.git
```
* From the command line, check for updates from upstream:
```
$ git pull upstream master
```
> From now on, do pull from upstream whenever you start a new sprint to ensure you have the latest tasks and notes.

### Sprint 5 Edit locally and push to remote 

* Do: Continuing from the previous sprint, make a local edit in VS Code by adding the
  keyboard shortcut to open the Integrated Terminal here:
```
REPLACE WITH KEYBOARD SHORTCUT
```
* Do: [Commit and push this back to your forked repository.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_commit)

### Sprint 6 Node.js and NPM

* Do: [Download and install LTS version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Do: Check that Node.js is installed
```
$ node --version
```
* Do: Check that NPM is installed
```
$ npm --version
```

### Sprint 7 Understand the Agile manifesto

* Read: [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
* Read: [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto] (https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
* Read: [What is Scrum?] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum)

### Sprint 8 Create a front-end

* Do: Clone ```https://github.com/vitoc/rad```
> Please clone this to a separate directory, do not clone this within the ```stoo``` directory
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Do: Rename the project directory to ```stoo-frontend```
* Create a repository on GitHub named ```stoo-front-end```
* Add the created repository as a remote on your local ```stoo-frontend```
=======
* Do: Follow through the Mods in the repository.
> By following the demo, you should arrive at a functional login / logout app
