# Sprint-based Technical Onboarding Objectives

Get technically onboarded to the Microsoft Azure approach to field-based development work in 6 sprints :)
Each sprint is planned for a week. We review the onboarding outcome on the Thursday of every week, and set about 
talking about the next sprint if all is well.

## Sprints

### Sprint 1: Version control and Github


* [Hello World!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* Read: [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
